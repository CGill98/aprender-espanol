lesson_part:Noun Gender{

desc{
The first thing to note about the Spanish language is
that nouns have genders. Nouns are either masculine or feminine and
we indicate this difference with use of the "definite article" which in
English is the word "the". There are two definite articles in Spanish,
El for masculine nouns and La for feminine nouns. A general rule is that
nouns ending in "a" are feminine and nouns ending in "o" are masculine.
